This work aims to evaluate the performance of different 
hybrid CNN-BiLSTM architectures for automatic violence 
detection in videos using the Hockey Fights dataset. A 
classification pipeline was designed by combining 
convolutional neural networks (ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, 
EfficientNetV2, and MobileNetV3) with bidirectional long 
short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) layers, varying the number of 
layers from 1 to 9. Each configuration was trained and 
evaluated using standard classification metrics such as 
accuracy, loss, and inference time. The results showed 
that all pipelines achieved optimal performance (99\% 
test accuracy), although with different Bi-LSTM 
configurations. Considering all the evaluation metrics, 
EfficientNetB0 proved to be the most stable model, offering 
better results in terms of precision, computational 
efficiency, and generalization.
