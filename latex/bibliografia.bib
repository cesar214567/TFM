   abstract = {The image super-resolution is utilized for the image transformation from low resolution to higher resolution to obtain more detailed information to identify the targets. The super-resolution has potential applications in various domains, such as medical image processing, crime investigation, remote sensing, and other image-processing application domains. The goal of the super-resolution is to obtain the image with minimal mean square error with improved perceptual quality. Therefore, this study introduces the perceptual loss minimization technique through efficient learning criteria. The proposed image reconstruction technique uses the image super-resolution generative adversarial network (ISRGAN), in which the learning of the discriminator in the ISRGAN is performed using the EfficientNet-v2 to obtain a better image quality. The proposed ISRGAN with the EfficientNet-v2 achieved a minimal loss of 0.02, 0.1, and 0.015 at the generator, discriminator, and self-supervised learning, respectively, with a batch size of 32. The minimal mean square error and mean absolute error are 0.001025 and 0.00225, and the maximal peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure obtained are 45.56985 and 0.9997, respectively.},

   abstract = {This paper introduces EfficientNetV2, a new family of convolutional networks that have faster training speed and better parameter efficiency than previous models. To develop this family of models, we use a combination of training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-MBConv. Our experiments show that EfficientNetV2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while being up to 6.8x smaller. Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e.g., dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast training and good accuracy. With progressive learning, our EfficientNetV2 significantly outperforms previous models on ImageNet and CIFAR/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on the same ImageNet21k, our EfficientNetV2 achieves 87.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ILSVRC2012, outperforming the recent ViT by 2.0% accuracy while training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources.

   abstract = {We present the next generation of MobileNets based on a combination of complementary search techniques as well as a novel architecture design. MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2\% more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 15\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 4.6\% more accurate while reducing latency by 5\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Large detection is 25\% faster at roughly the same accuracy as MobileNetV2 on COCO detection. MobileNetV3-Large LR-ASPP is 30\% faster than MobileNetV2 R-ASPP at similar accuracy for Cityscapes segmentation.},

   abstract = {The sixth generation (6G) represents the next evolution in wireless communication technology and is currently under research and development. It is expected to deliver faster speeds, reduced latency, and greater capacity compared to the current 5G wireless technology. 6G is envisioned as a technology capable of establishing a fully data-driven network, proficient in analyzing and optimizing end-to-end behavior and handling massive volumes of real-time data at rates of up to terabits per second (Tb/s). Moreover, 6G is designed to accommodate an average of 1000+ substantial connections per person over the course of a decade. The concept of a data-driven network introduces a new service paradigm, which offers fresh opportunities for applications within 6G wireless communication and network design in the future. This paper aims to provide a survey of existing applications of 6G that are based on deep learning techniques. It also explores the potential, essential technologies, scenarios, challenges, and related topics associated with 6G. These aspects are crucial for meeting the requirements for the development of future intelligent networks. Furthermore, this work delves into various research gaps between deep learning and 6G that remain unexplored. Different potential deep learning applications for 6G networks, including privacy, security, environmentally friendly communication, sustainability, and various wireless applications, are discussed. Additionally, we shed light on the challenges and future trends in this field.

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

However, this sometimes not realized and ignored by society, even though many diseases that can be seen through the condition of the nails and the shape of the nails are one of the systemic diseases. This research was conducted to detect abnormalities in the nail based on digital images. The detected abnormalities are terry's nails in the hand which can represent systemic diseases, while the method used is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method. This research uses Tensorflow Inception-V3 architecture model with the transfer learning method where the results of the experiments that have been done are obtained with 95.24% accuracy.},

@article{transfer-learning,
   abstract = {In a human-centered intelligent manufacturing system, every element is to assist the operator in achieving the optimal operational performance. The primary task of developing such a human-centered system is to accurately understand human behavior. In this paper, we propose a fog computing framework for assembly operation recognition, which brings computing power close to the data source in order to achieve real-time recognition. For data collection, the operator's activity is captured using visual cameras from different perspectives. For operation recognition, instead of directly building and training a deep learning model from scratch, which needs a huge amount of data, transfer learning is applied to transfer the learning abilities to our application. A worker assembly operation dataset is established, which at present contains 10 sequential operations in an assembly task of installing a desktop CNC machine. The developed transfer learning model is evaluated on this dataset and achieves a recognition accuracy of 95% in the testing experiments.},

@article{EfficientNetB0,
   abstract = {Climate change has been a common interest and the forefront of crucial political discussion and decision-making for many years. Shallow clouds play a significant role in understanding the Earth's climate, but they are challenging to interpret and represent in a climate model. By classifying these cloud structures, there is a better possibility of understanding the physical structures of the clouds, which would improve the climate model generation, resulting in a better prediction of climate change or forecasting weather update. Clouds organise in many forms, which makes it challenging to build traditional rule-based algorithms to separate cloud features. In this paper, classification of cloud organization patterns was performed using a new scaled-up version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named as EfficientNet as the encoder and UNet as decoder where they worked as feature extractor and reconstructor of fine grained feature map and was used as a classifier, which will help experts to understand how clouds will shape the future climate. By using a segmentation model in a classification task, it was shown that with a good encoder alongside UNet, it is possible to obtain good performance from this dataset. Dice coefficient has been used for the final evaluation metric, which gave the score of 66.26\% and 66.02\% for public and private (test set) leaderboard on Kaggle competition respectively.},
