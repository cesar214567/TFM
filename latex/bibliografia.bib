	abstract = {We establish sharp W2,p regularity estimates for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic equations under minimal, asymptotic assumptions on the governing operator F. By means of geometric tangential methods, we show that if the recession of the operator F – formally given by F⁎(M):=∞−1F(∞M) – is convex, then any viscosity solution to the original equation F(D2u)=f(x) is locally of class W2,p, provided f∈Lp, p>d, with appropriate universal estimates. Our result extends to operators with variable coefficients and in this setting they are new even under convexity of the frozen coefficient operator, M↦F(x0,M), as oscillation is measured only at the recession level. The methods further yield BMO regularity of the Hessian, provided the source lies in that space. As a final application, we establish the density of W2,p solutions within the class of all continuous viscosity solutions, for generic fully nonlinear operators F. This result gives an alternative tool for treating common issues often faced in the theory of viscosity solutions.
	Résumé
	Dans cet article on établit la régularité W2,p des solutions de viscosité des équations elliptiques complètement nonlinéaires. On utilise une méthode géométrique tangentielle, qui est basée sur la notion de fonction de recession d'un opérateur arbitraire F – formellement donnée par F⁎(M):=∞−1F(∞M). De plus, on examine le problème de l'opérateur avec coefficients variables, et on étudie la régularité des solutions dans l'espace BMO. La dernière partie traite d'un résultat concernant la densité des solutions W2,p dans la classe des solutions de viscosité continue.}

   abstract = {El reconocimiento de acciones en videos es actualmente un tema de interés en el área de la visión por computador, debido a potenciales aplicaciones como: indexación multimedia, vigilancia en espacios públicos, entre otras. Los mecanismos de atención se han convertido en un concepto muy importante dentro del enfoque de aprendizaje profundo, su operación intenta imitar la capacidad visual de las personas que les permite enfocar su atención en partes relevantes de una escena para extraer información importante. En este artículo proponemos un mecanismo de atención suave adaptado para degradar la arquitectura CNN–LSTM. Primero, una red neuronal convolucional VGG16 extrae las características del video de entrada. Para llevar a cabo las fases de entrenamiento y prueba, usamos los conjuntos de datos HMDB-51 y UCF-101. Evaluamos el desempeño de nuestro sistema usando la precisión como métrica de evaluación, obteniendo 40,7 % (enfoque base), 51,2 % (con atención) para HMDB-51 y 75,8 % (enfoque base), 87,2 % (con atención) para UCF-101.},

   abstract = {Dealing with imbalanced data is a prevalent problem while performing classification on the datasets. Many times, this problem contributes to bias while making decisions or implementing policies. Thus, it is vital to understand the factors which causes imbalance in the data (or class imbalance). Such hidden biases and imbalances can lead to data tyranny, and a major challenge to a data democracy. In this chapter, two essential statistical elements are resolved: the degree of class imbalance and the complexity of the concept, solving such issues helps in building the foundations of a data democracy. Further, statistical measures which are appropriate in these scenarios are discussed and implemented on a real-life dataset (car insurance claims). In the end, popular data-level methods such as Random Oversampling, Random Undersampling, SMOTE, Tomek Link, and others are implemented in Python, and their performance is compared.},

   abstract = {Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance units largely rely on the support of surveillance operators. Although this job is cognitively challenging, few studies have investigated the main human factors improving the ability to detect critical incidents in this context. This study aimed to explore the contribution of individual characteristics and cognitive abilities to performance in a realistic CCTV monitoring simulation. Non-expert participants took part in a surveillance simulation and were screened on several measures of individual differences. Improved detection abilities and quicker speed of detection were related to lower age and to better knowledge of the area, cognitive flexibility, working memory, and visual/threat detection abilities. Moreover, more false alarms were associated with higher goal commitment but with lower working memory, visual/threat detection abilities, and cognitive flexibility. Results highlight the potential to screen for a series of cognitive and non-cognitive skills as part of personnel selection procedures for CCTV centers.},

   abstract = {Detection of a violence event in surveillance systems is playing a significant role in law enforcement and city safety. The effectiveness of violence event detectors measures by the speed of response and the accuracy and the generality over different kind of video sources with a different format. Several studies worked on the violence detection with focus either on speed or accuracy or both but not taking into account the generality over different kind of video sources. In this paper, we proposed a real-time violence detector based on deep-learning methods. The proposed model consists of CNN as a spatial feature extractor and LSTM as temporal relation learning method with a focus on the three-factor (overall generality - accuracy - fast response time). The suggested model achieved 98% accuracy with speed of 131 frames/sec. Comparison of the accuracy and the speed of the proposed model with previous works illustrated that the proposed model provides the highest accuracy and the fastest speed among all the previous works in the field of violence detection.},

The aim is to create a complete system that can perform real-time video analysis which will help recognize the presence of any violent activities and notify the same to the concerned authority, such as the police department of the corresponding area. Using the deep learning networks CNN and LSTM along with a well-defined system architecture, we have achieved an efficient solution that can be used for real-time analysis of video footage so that the concerned authority can monitor the situation through a mobile application that can notify about an occurrence of a violent event immediately.},
